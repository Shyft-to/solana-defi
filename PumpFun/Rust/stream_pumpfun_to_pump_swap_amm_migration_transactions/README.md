# Real-Time Token Migration Alerts: Pump.fun to Pumpfun Amm

Stay ahead of the curve with this high-performance, real-time tracking system that instantly alerts you when a token migrates from Pump.fun to Pumpfun Amm. As soon as a token completes its bonding phase on Pump.fun, the system scans transaction data for the key `migrate` instruction â€” a reliable indicator of migration. Once detected, it enriches the data for transparency and immediately triggers an alert.

## How the Code Detects Token Migrations (Step-by-Step):
1. Scans Each Parsed Transaction: The code monitors real-time Solana transactions and inspects the parsed instructions of each transaction.

2. Looks for the `migrate` Instruction: It specifically searches for a transaction instruction named `migrate`, which signals that a token is moving from Pump.fun to Pumpfun Amm.

3. Filters Only Migration Events: If no `migrate` instruction is found, the transaction is ignored. Only migrations are processed further.

4. Enriches Transaction Data: For detected migrations, it enhances the transaction object by attaching related metadata and inner instructions for deeper insight.

5. Triggers Real-Time Alerts: Once enriched, this transaction can be used to immediately notify users (via alerting mechanisms you define) of a live token migration.

6. Implemented in Rust: The entire detection logic is implemented in Rust, ensuring performance and reliability out-of-the-box.
