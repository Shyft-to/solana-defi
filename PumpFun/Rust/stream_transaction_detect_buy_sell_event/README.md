# Stream Pumpfun Transactions and Track Buy/Sell Events in Real-Time  

This project focuses on streaming Pump.fun transactions using gRPC and parsing buy/sell events in real-time. By decoding transaction data, it identifies key details such as the buyer/seller addresses and the transaction amounts. The implementation leverages Rust’s performance and type safety to efficiently process high-throughput transaction streams from Solana’s ecosystem. Structured for seamless integration, this solution extracts actionable insights from Pump.fun and Token Program instructions, enabling real-time analysis of market activity. Ideal for traders and developers, it provides a robust foundation for tracking and analyzing on-chain trading behavior on Pump.fun.
