# Streaming and parsing Pumpfun Amm accounts using gRPC

This project utilizes **Solana's gRPC streaming capabilities** to monitor and analyze **pump fun Automated Market Maker (AMM) account data** 
in real-time on the Solana blockchain.
By leveraging **GlobalConfig** and **PoolAccount** data, it enables precise parsing of key account information, 
providing insights into market trends, liquidity, and transactions.
With Solana’s high-performance network and low-latency streaming,
users gain up-to-date visibility into pump fun activities on the decentralized exchange (DEX), 
empowering faster decision-making. 
This project enhances the ability to track **DeFi** activities on Solana,
offering developers and traders a powerful tool for engaging with the **AMM** ecosystem.
