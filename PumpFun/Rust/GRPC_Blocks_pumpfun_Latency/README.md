# Latency Test Program for Streaming Blocks and Filtering by Pumpfun Program ID

This program measures the latency of streaming blocks while filtering transactions associated with the Pumpfun program ID. It does so by comparing on-chain blocks with transaction blocks to evaluate performance.


run with:
cargo run -- --endpoint https://grpc.ny.shyft.to --x-token<gRpc Token>



--PS: 
-- Include your API KEY in Latest_block.rs line(6) 
-- This code only works for Pumpfun Program
-- DON'T attempt to use the code for any other program
