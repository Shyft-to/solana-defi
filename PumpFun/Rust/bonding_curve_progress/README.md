# Monitoring Bonding Curve Progress

This project is designed to stream and monitor the progress of bonding curves on Pumpfunâ€”a platform that enables the tracking and analysis of token dynamics. By leveraging the power of gRPC, this tool allows users to get real-time updates on the bonding curve progress of tokens listed on Pumpfun, providing insights into token behavior, pricing mechanisms, and market liquidity.
```
$ cargo run -- --endpoint <endpoint> --x-token <token>
```
