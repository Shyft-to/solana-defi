#  Stream Pump.fun Token Transactions & Fetch Bonding Pool Liquidity in Real Time

This code enables real-time streaming of Pump.fun token transactions while simultaneously fetching liquidity details. As a token progresses through its bonding curve, the code retrieves its current liquidity pool details and distinguishes whether each transaction is a buy or a sell. With its unique transaction parsing method, you gain valuable insights into token movements and market activityâ€”all in real time.
