# Modify your Subscribe Request

Modify your subscribe request without closing or reconnecting your stream. 
This approach offers significant improvements in efficiency, providing a smoother and more continuous data flow.

Typically, when modifying subscription parameters in many streaming systems, users have to disconnect and reconnect, causing delays and interruptions. However, our method allows real-time adjustments to subscription parameters without disrupting the stream, ensuring that your connection remains active and reliable. This seamless modification of requests enhances the overall experience by reducing latency and minimizing downtime.

PS:
 run `server.ts` on a different terminal with ts-node.cmd `server.ts`
 run your stream with `npm run start`
