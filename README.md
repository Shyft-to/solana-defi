## Solana Defi Resources

We understand working with defi isnt an easy task on Solana. From streaming data through gRPC, to parsing and dealing with IDLs for multiple Dexes can be intimidating. Thats why Shyft is bringing you the most extensive resource of ready to use example codes, covering top dexes and use cases on Solana.

- Raydium
- Pumpfun
- Orca
- Meteora

All this in your favorite languages, typescript and rust.

Please make sure you host your code/server in the same region as gRPC for lowest latency.
