# Real-Time Streaming and Parsing of Meteora DAMM Account Updates on Solana via Shyft gRPC

This project uses Shyft gRPC to stream Meteora DAMM account data in real-time on the Solana blockchain. With the help of gRPCâ€™s fast and reliable connection, it allows for continuous monitoring of account activity related to liquidity pools.

The main goal is to read and understand Meteora DAMM account data, focusing on important changes and updates in the pools. This helps users get useful insights into liquidity flow, pool performance, and overall pool status.

## Key highlights:

1. Utilizes gRPC streaming for high-performance, real-time data delivery.

2. Parses on-chain account structures to extract meaningful state changes.

3. Monitors liquidity pool behavior and updates for informed analytics.
