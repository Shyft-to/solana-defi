# Real-Time Streaming and Parsing of Meteora DAMM v2 Account Updates on Solana via Shyft gRPC

This project uses Shyft gRPC to stream Meteora DAMM v2 account data in real-time on the Solana blockchain. Leveraging gRPCâ€™s fast and reliable connection, it enables continuous monitoring of account activity related to liquidity pools.

The primary goal is to read and interpret Meteora DAMM v2 account data, with a focus on significant changes and updates in the pools. This provides users with valuable insights into liquidity flow, pool performance, and the overall status of the pools.
## Key highlights:

1. Utilizes gRPC streaming for high-performance, real-time data delivery.

2. Parses on-chain account structures to extract meaningful state changes.

3. Monitors liquidity pool behavior and updates for informed analytics.
