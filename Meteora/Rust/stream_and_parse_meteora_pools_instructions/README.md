# Streaming Meteora Pools transaction using gRPC and parsing instructions in Rust

This project streams meteora pools transactions from gRPC, parsing both meteora pools and Token Program instructions in real-time. It efficiently decodes transaction data, extracts meaningful insights, and structures the parsed instructions into a serializable format for easy processing and analysis. The implementation ensures smooth integration with Solana’s ecosystem, leveraging Rust’s strong type safety and performance for handling high-throughput transaction streams.

```
$ cargo run -- --endpoint <endpoint> --x-token <token>
```
