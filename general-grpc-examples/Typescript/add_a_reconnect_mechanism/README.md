# Adding a Reconnection mechanism to your gRPC connection


In the context of Solana, a "reconnection mechanism" within gRPC refers to the strategies and code implementations that automatically re-establish a communication link between a client application and a Solana node when the connection is unexpectedly lost. In this example, we illustrate how we can
reconnect a gRPC connection, once it has stopped streaming due to some problem.

## Getting Started

1. **Pre-requisites:**  
    This project works with any Solana gRPC. The `.env` file takes in two values: `GRPC_URL` which is your gRPC connection endpoint and `X_TOKEN` which is your access token. For gRPCs which do not require the access, please keep the latter field blank.   

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shyft-to/solana-defi.git
   cd general-grpc-examples/Typescript/add_a_reconnect_mechanism
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # For example, if using npm
    npm i
    ```

4. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    # To run the script
    npm run start

    # or you can also use
    npx ts-node index.ts
    ```
This will stream reconnect the gRPC automatically, in case of any disconnections.

*Note: Please rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and input your env details before running the script.*
